- It runs on the JVM and is compatible with Java, allowing for easy integration with existing Java codebases.<br><br>
- Every value in Scala is an object, and it supports advanced features like type inference, pattern matching, and immutability.<br><br>
- Scala is known for its concise syntax and is used for a wide range of applications, from web development to big data processing with frameworks like Apache Spark.

# Variables, Values and Types
